The **Supervisely Potatoes Dataset for Crops and Weed Segmentation** is tailored for the agricultural task of crop recognition. It encompasses the visual data of potato leaves (*crop*) and various types of *weed* objects. More than just a resource for training models, this dataset serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating the efficiency of pre-trained models.

The source videos were meticulously recorded in June 2023 in Alastani, a province in the country of Georgia. The footage was captured at a precise 90-degree angle using an iPhone 11 Plus camera, boasting a resolution of 3840x2160 and a smooth frame rate of 30 FPS.

To enhance usability within the Supervisely platform, the original videos underwent a transformation into an annotated collection of individual images. This conversion not only facilitates seamless integration but also streamlines the analysis process within the realm of agricultural model development and assessment.
